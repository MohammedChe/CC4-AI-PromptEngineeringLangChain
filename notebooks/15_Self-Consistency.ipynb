    "## Self-Consistency Prompting in Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-consistency prompting was introduced in the March 2022 paper [\"Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11171.pdf) by Xuezhi Wang, et. al.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🤔 **What is Self-Consistency Prompting?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Focuses on exploring different reasoning paths for complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Aims for reliable answers by checking consistency across various thought processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌟 **Differences from Other Prompting Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traditional CoT: Generates short sentences mimicking human reasoning for solving tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Self-Consistency: Samples multiple reasoning paths and finds the most consistent answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's unsupervised and works with pre-trained models, unlike methods needing extra training or human annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🛠️ Constructing a Self-Consistency Prompt**\n",
    "\n",

    "<figure>\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ff73Y-RaEAANaqT.jpg\" alt=\"Image Description\" style=\"width:100%\">\n",
    "  <figcaption>The self-consistency method contains three steps: (1) prompt a language model using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting; (2) replace the “greedy decode” in CoT prompting by sampling from the language model’s decoder to generate a diverse set of reasoning paths; and (3) marginalize out the reasoning paths and aggregate by choosing the most consistent answer in the final answer set.</figcaption>\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start with CoT**: Use chain-of-thought prompting as the base.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sample Diverse Paths**: Use \"sample-and-marginalize\" decoding to get various reasoning paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Marginalize for Consistency**: Find the most consistent answer from these different paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 **Examples in Action**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chain-of-Thought**: For the question \"If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?\", instead of directly answering \"5\", the model might respond with the reasoning: \"There are 3 cars in the parking lot already. 2 more arrive. Now there are 3 + 2 = 5 cars. The answer is 5.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Self-Consistency**: For a question about how much Janet makes from selling eggs, the model might generate multiple reasoning paths like:\n",
    "  1. \"She has 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs left. So she makes $2 * 9 = $18 per day.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. \"This means she sells the remainder for $2 * (16 - 4 - 3) = $26 per day.\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "  3. \"She eats 3 for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 left. Then she bakes muffins, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left. So she has 9 eggs * $2 = $18.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  The model then aggregates these paths to determine the most consistent answer, which in this case is \"$18 per day.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🚀 **Impact of Self-Consistency Prompting**\n",
    "- Enhances model reasoning by considering multiple paths.\n",
    "- Shown to boost performance in arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
