    "#🔗 **Origins of CoT Prompting**\n",
    "\n",
    "- CoT was introduced by Wei et al. in their 2022 paper, [Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://browse.arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11903.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's a response to the need for better reasoning in large language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **What is CoT Prompting?**\n",
    "- CoT stands for Chain of Thought Prompting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's about guiding language models through a step-by-step reasoning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model shows its reasoning, forming a \"chain\" of thoughts, rather than just giving an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mimics human-like thought processes for complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎓 **Standard vs. CoT Prompting Example**\n",

    "- Standard: Direct answer with no reasoning (e.g., \"11\").\n",
    "\n",
    "- CoT: Detailed reasoning steps (e.g., \"Roger started with 5, added 6 from 2 cans, so 5 + 6 = 11\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **Usage of CoT Prompting**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enhanced Reasoning**: Breaks down complex problems into simpler steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Combination with Few-Shot Prompting**: Uses examples to guide model responses, great for complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interpretability**: Offers a clear view of the model's thought process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Applications**: Useful in arithmetic, commonsense reasoning, and symbolic tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✨ **Impact of CoT Prompting**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improves accuracy and insightfulness in responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Focuses on reasoning and interpretability, especially in complex scenarios."

Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock. Others, such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and a wide range of opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley (beer), rice (sake) and grapes (wine).\\n\\nNow answer this question: Where do some medicines and recreational drugs come from?', 'target': 'from plants', 'rationale': 'The article states that many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants.

      "Query: Here's a short story: A lifter uses a barbell, but moves a jump rope in a wider arc. The object likely to travel further is (A) the jump rope (B) the barbell.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the most sensical answer between \"a jump rope\" and  \"a barbell\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "Rationale: The statement \"a lifter uses a barbell, but moves a jump rope in a wider arc\" is comparing the two objects. \n",
      "A barbell is used for weightlifting and has 2 weights on each end of an iron rod. A jump rope is used for jumping exercises and consists of one thin cord wrapped around handles or gripped at both ends. Both are relatively light-weight objects with low mass that can be held by hand; however, because it covers more distance during exercise (i) requires less effort to move (ii) travels farther when dropped compared to the other object mentioned: the barbell which likely weighs much heavier than either choice given as answers (\"the Barbell\".\n",
      "Therefore answer @option 1(\"a jump rope\") would make sense while choosing between these two options\n",

      "\n",
      "What is the most sensical answer between \"reed\" and  \"stick\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "Rationale: The question asks which object will be less likely to break if bent. The story states that a reed is more flexible than a stick, and flexibility refers to the ability of an item to bend without breaking or becoming misshapen. This implies that when held at equal angles, the reed would be able hold its shape better than the stick, making it \"less likely\" to break in comparison with a stick.\n",
      "So based on this logic and context, option A (\"reed\") is the most sensical answer\n",

      "Query: In this task, you need to answer basic science questions. For each question, several terms are intentionally masked with ***. This masking can cover very few or many of the question words. Clearly, if masked terms are important, the modified question will be impossible to answer. Please indicate the correct answer with one of the following responses: \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\" or \"E\". While \"A\"-\"D\" correspond to the answer options provided in the input, \"E\" represents \"I don't know\" for questions that do not provide enough information. Respond via \"E\" if the question is not answerable. Do not generate anything else apart from one of the following characters: 'A', 'B, 'C', 'D', 'E'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: A *** is an *** of which *** of *** ***?  (A) lever (B) pulley (C) wheel (D) inclined plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rationale: The question is unanswerable because the masked terms are essential to answering the question. The question asks \"What is an ___ of which ___ of ___ ___?\" Therefore, it asks for a specific type of object (e.g., lever, pulley or wheel). However, this information is not provided due to the masking in the question. Consequently, there are many possible answers and thus it is impossible to determine which object out of all possible objects would be correct. As a result, we do not know which answer option (\"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\") corresponds to the correct answer for this question and therefore can only respond with 'E'.\n",

      "What is the most sensical answer between \"Truck\" and  \"Motorcycle\"?\n",

      "Rationale: The short story talks about two objects, a truck and a motorcycle. It states that the both accelerate as fast as possible to 40 mph. The question then asks which one will be the last one to reach 40 miles per hour.\n",
      "A truck is much heavier than a motorcycle and also has more power due to its bigger engine size compared with a motorbike's smaller engine size so it will likely take longer for it to get up to speed than for the lighter-weighted bike (with less powerful engines). That means that if accelerates \"as fast as possible\", the Truck would still have an advantage over Motorcycle because of their differences in weight/engine sizes when they are accelerating at full capacity or \"as fast as possible\".\n",

      "\n",
      "Rationale: In the story, Glenn rolls a marble on a table and it moves very easily. He then rolls the same marble across a carpet and it moves slowly and not as far. This is because there was less friction between the marble and the smooth surface of the table than when rolling across rough carpet fibers. So, answer A: \"table\" makes more sense than B: \"carpet\".\n",

      "Query: Answer the question depending on the context.\n",
      "Context: On the uneven bars, the gymnast performs a routine on two horizontal bars set at different heights. These bars are made of fiberglass covered in wood laminate, to prevent them from breaking. In the past, bars were made of wood, but the bars were prone to breaking, providing an incentive to switch to newer technologies. The width and height of the bars may be adjusted. In the past, the uneven parallel bars were closer together. They've been moved increasingly further apart, allowing gymnasts to perform swinging, circling, transitional, and release moves, that may pass over, under, and between the two bars. At the Elite level, movements must pass through the handstand. Gymnasts often mount the Uneven Bars using a springboard, or a small mat. Chalk and grips (a leather strip with holes for fingers to protect hands and improve performance) may be used while doing this event. The chalk helps take the moisture out of gymnast's hands to decrease friction and prevent rips (tears to the skin of the hands), dowel grips help gymnasts grip the bar.;\n",
      "Question: What are the uneven bars?;\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "Rationale: The context describes the \"uneven bars\", also known as asymmetric parallel bars, and explains that they consist of two horizontal bars set at different heights. \n",
      "Therefore, the answer is: \"two horizontal bars set at different heights\".\n",
      "\n",
