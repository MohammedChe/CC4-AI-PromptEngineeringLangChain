    "**Key Differences for Chat Models**:\n",
    "- 🎭 Formatted as dialogues, not just Q&A.\n",
    "- 🗨️ Mimics back-and-forth interactions.\n",
    "- 🌟 Teaches conversational flow and tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crafting Few-Shot Examples for Chat:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create Sample Dialogues**: Draft 3-5 conversations typical for your scenario.\n",
    "2. **Dialogue Format**: Set them up as human-to-AI message exchanges.\n",
    "3. **Implement Templates**: Use something like `FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate` for structure.\n",
    "4. **Model Training**: The chat model uses these dialogues to predict and respond appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, it's like giving your chatbot a script rehearsal before the live show.\n",

    "- **Examples List**: Predefined conversation snippets.\n",
    "- **Example Prompt**: A method to translate each snippet into a mini-dialogue.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is your chatbot's practice script, ensuring it knows its lines for the performance.\n",

    "Later, we'll explore how to pull the most suitable script for any given live interaction.\n"
