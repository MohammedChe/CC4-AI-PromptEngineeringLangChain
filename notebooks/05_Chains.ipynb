    "  - **Step 1**: Classifies a question into categories (literature, history, biology, philosophy, or other).\n",

       "'Here’s a concise guide to Stoic philosophy aimed at living a good life.\\n\\nWhat Stoicism is about\\n- The good life is a life of virtue. Virtue (wisdom, justice, courage, temperance) is the only true good; wealth, health, and reputation are “indifferents” that can help or hinder but do not determine your well-being.\\n- Live in accordance with nature. For Stoics, reason is part of human nature and also part of the rational order of the universe. Living well means using reason to align your choices with that order.\\n- Focus on what you can control. Your own judgments, choices, and reactions are within your control; everything else (others’ actions, weather, global events) is not. Peace comes from directing your energy to the former.\\n\\nThe four cardinal virtues\\n- Wisdom (prudent judgment): discerning what is truly good or bad and choosing rightly.\\n- Justice (fair treatment of others): fulfilling your duties, being honest, and respecting others as fellow rational beings.\\n- Courage (moral strength): standing firm in your values and doing what is right, even in adversity.\\n- Temperance (self-control): moderating desires and impulses to act with steadiness and self-discipline.\\n\\nKey ideas and practices\\n- The dichotomy of control: Then ask yourself, “What is up to me?” and “What is not up to me?” Worry, fear, or frustration should be directed only at things you can influence.\\n- Virtue as the only good: External things (health, wealth, status) are preferred or dispreferred only insofar as they help or hinder living virtuously, not as sources of true happiness.\\n- Living according to nature: Use reason, fulfill your social duties, and participate in the larger human community. Consider your actions in light of their impact on others.\\n- Acceptance of fate (amor fati): Recognize that events unfold as part of a rational order. You can’t control them, but you can shape your response to them.\\n- Inner tranquility (apatheia/ataraxia): Not a lack of feeling, but freedom from being ruled by disruptive passions through rational judgment.\\n- Negative visualization: Regularly imagine losing what you have or facing hardship. This strengthens appreciation, reduces fear, and prepares you to respond calmly.\\n- Voluntary discomfort: Occasionally endure small self-denial or hardship to build resilience and gratitude.\\n- View from above and perspective: Step back and see your life in a larger context, which helps keep petty troubles in proportion.\\n- Social responsibility: You are part of a community. Treat others as fellow rational beings and act justly in family, work, and civic life.\\n\\nHow to apply these ideas in modern life\\n- In relationships: Practice fairness, honesty, and you’ll respond with patience when others disappoint you. See others as fellow humans with their own reasons and challenges.\\n- At work: Focus on doing your duties well and with integrity. Accept outcomes you cannot control and learn from feedback and setbacks.\\n- When stressed or overwhelmed: Use the dichotomy of control. Reframe the situation to identify what you can change (your reaction, your plan) and what you cannot (external events).\\n- For health and resilience: Use voluntary discomfort (short, purposeful challenges) to strengthen self-discipline; employ negative visualization to appreciate what you have and prepare for potential losses.\\n- Ethical decision-making: Before acting, ask which choice demonstrates wisdom, justice, courage, and temperance.\\n\\nCommon misunderstandings\\n- Stoicism is not cold detachment. It seeks inner freedom through disciplined emotion and rational judgment, not absence of feeling.\\n- It doesn’t advocate passive resignation. It encourages active, virtuous response to whatever happens.\\n- It’s not anti-social. It emphasizes our duties to others and to the larger human community.\\n\\nA simple starter plan (one week)\\n- Morning: Briefly reflect on the day’s major virtue you want to practice (e.g., patience, honesty). Remind yourself of the dichotomy of control.\\n- Daytime: Treat others well, do your work with integrity, and pause before reacting to provocation.\\n- Evening: Review the day. Note what went well, what you could improve, and whether you acted in line with virtue. Do a small bit of negative visualization for future resilience.\\n- Regular practice: Try one session of voluntary discomfort (short cold exposure, a less comfortable routine) once or twice a week; read a short Stoic passage daily (from Epictetus, Seneca, or Marcus Aurelius) to reinforce the mindset.\\n\\nIf you’d like, I can tailor this into a personalized, week-by-week plan or pull together a short reading list of Stoic texts and practical exercises.'"

      "Stoic philosophy, originating in ancient Greece and later developed in Rome, is a school of thought that teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive emotions. It is not merely an intellectual enterprise but a way of life, emphasizing ethics as the main focus of human knowledge. Stoicism outlines a path to personal happiness and wisdom, which is achieved through understanding the workings of the universe and our place within it. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the heart of Stoic philosophy for a good life are several key principles:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Understanding What is in Our Control**: The Stoics distinguish between what is in our control and what is not. According to Epictetus, one of the most prominent Stoic philosophers, things in our control include our own opinions, impulses, desires, and aversions. Everything else, including our bodies, possessions, and reputations, is not truly ours and not in our control. Recognizing this distinction helps individuals focus on their own actions and attitudes, leading to inner peace and resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Living According to Nature**: Stoics believe that living in agreement with nature means understanding the rational structure of the universe and living in accordance with it. This entails recognizing our nature as rational beings and living a life of virtue, which is the sole good in Stoic philosophy. Virtue consists of wisdom, courage, justice, and moderation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **The Four Cardinal Virtues**: Stoicism holds that a good life is achieved through the practice of the four cardinal virtues. Wisdom or prudence is the knowledge of what we should do, what we should not do, and what is neither. Courage is not merely physical bravery but the strength to face any situation, particularly adversity, with confidence and valour. Justice involves dealing fairly and equitably with others, acting with integrity, and performing one's roles in society well. Temperance or moderation is the self-control and discipline over one's desires and impulses.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Emotional Resilience through Rationality**: Stoics aim for apatheia, a state of tranquillity arising from the absence of irrational or harmful emotions. This doesn't mean the absence of all feelings, but rather freedom from the negative emotions that arise from poor judgments and attachments to things beyond our control. By using reason, we can reassess our impressions of events, recognizing that external events in themselves do not cause distress, but our judgments about them do.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **The Dichotomy of Control**: A core Stoic practice is to continually remind oneself of the difference between what is within our control and what is not. This awareness encourages a focus on our own actions and responses, leading to a reduction in suffering and frustration with external circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Cosmopolitanism**: The Stoics were early proponents of cosmopolitanism—the idea that all human beings, regardless of their social, racial, or political divisions, belong to a single community. They advocated for understanding and compassion towards all people, emphasizing that we should live not just for ourselves, but for the wellbeing of the global community.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Acceptance and Amor Fati**: Stoicism teaches acceptance of everything that happens, seeing it as part of a rational order in the universe. Amor fati, the love of fate, is a Stoic principle that encourages us to embrace whatever life throws at us, not merely to bear it as a necessary evil but to love it and see it as something that was meant for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Living a good life, according to Stoicism, is thus about cultivating virtue, exercising rational judgment, and maintaining emotional equilibrium through the ups and downs of life. It’s about recognizing what truly matters, focusing on our own character and actions, and embracing our place within the broader community and the natural world."

       "'- Live as a Roman and a human: perform every action with gravity, natural affection, freedom, and justice; treat each act as if it were your last, avoiding vanity, hypocrisy, self-love, and needless complaints about fate. The gods require little more if you stay true to reason.\\n\\n- Happiness comes from within. Respect yourself, rather than basing your worth on others’ opinions; chasing external approval tends to undermine true well-being.\\n\\n- Don’t be distracted by externals or wander aimlessly. Focus your efforts toward a definite, virtuous end and keep your desires directed by reason; those who lack self-command are unhappy.\\n\\n- Always reflect on the nature of the universe and your place in it; act and speak in accordance with nature, and remember that nothing outside yourself can truly hinder you from living rightly.\\n\\n- Sinful acts differ in kind: sins of lust are worse than sins of anger because lust betrays a weaker, more unmanly disposition; anger is grief and a momentary deviation from reason.\\n\\n- Live as though you may die at any moment; if gods exist, they do not harm you; if not, life without divine providence would still prompt you to act rightly. Evil lies in what is within your own power to avoid, not in external events; nothing in life is inherently good or bad.\\n\\n- All things are transient; worldly pleasures and appearances are vile or corruptible; true life lies in virtue, not in external goods.\\n\\n- Contemplate what you are and what death means; detach from common fears about dying, viewing death as a natural part of life and not something to dread.\\n\\n- Consider how the soul is joined to, and related to, the divine; recognize the part of you that is connected to God and seek harmony with that divine nature.'"

       "\"II. Yo, focus on being real as a Roman, as a dude, doing your thing with deep seriousness, love, freedom, and fairness. Forget all that other noise in your head about easing your mind. You got this if you treat every move like it's your last, cutting out all the fake stuff, all emotional and stubborn deviations from reason, and all that faking and self-love. You gotta let go of hating what fate or the big man upstairs throws at you. There ain't much required to keep on a winning streak and live that godly life, 'cause the gods ain't asking for more than just sticking to these rules.\\n\\nIII. Do your thing, soul, trash and disrespect yourself; but remember, time's running out for self-respect. Your happiness is on you, but here you are, life slipping away, playing yourself, thinking your joy comes from what others think.\\n\\nIV. Why let the outside stuff mess with you so bad? Take a minute to learn something solid and stop wandering around aimlessly. Watch out for that other kind of wandering, too, where people bust their backs in life without any real goal or desire guiding them. Remember, hardly anyone gets unhappy by minding their own business and not sweating what's in another person's soul. Those who don't steer their soul with reason are bound to be miserable.\\n\\nVI. Keep these in your mind: What's the universe about, and what's your role in it? How do you fit into the grand scheme, and remember, nobody can stop you from acting and speaking in harmony with your true nature.\\n\\nVII. Theophrastus, like a true philosopher, said that sins done in lust are worse than those done in anger. Anger might show someone turning away from reason out of pain, but giving into pleasure shows a weaker, less manly vibe. So, he argues, falling for pleasure is worse than reacting in anger, 'cause at least the angry dude was provoked first.\\n\\nVIII. Whatever you're into, whatever your plans, roll with them like you might peace out any second. And about death, if there are gods, they won't do you dirty. If there aren't, or they don't care, why stick around in a godless scene? But hey, there are gods, and they do look out for us. They've given us the power to dodge the truly nasty stuff, like vice. If there was anything else really bad, they'd help us avoid that too. So why sweat what doesn't change who you are? The universe ain't messed up enough to let the good and bad happen without reason. As for life, death, props, dissing, work, fun, riches, broke times, they hit everyone the same, but they don't define us.\\n\\nIX. Think about how quickly everything breaks down and goes back to the earth, and memories fade into time. Reflect on the nature of all the flashy, tempting, or annoying stuff out there – how empty, fleeting, and lifeless they really are.\\n\\nX. If you're smart, you'll think about who's really handing out props and what dying actually means. Strip death of all the drama, and it's just nature doing its thing. Being scared of nature's work is kid stuff. Death? It's natural and even helpful.\\n\\nXI. Consider how we connect with the divine, and how that divine bit in us feels when it's spread out. Nothing's more pitiful than a soul lost, roaming everything, looking for something it can't even name.\""
