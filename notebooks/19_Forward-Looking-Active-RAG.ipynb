    "# FLARE\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is FLARE?\n",
    "\n",
    "[FLARE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.06983.pdf) stands for `Forward-Looking Active REtrieval` augmented generation.  This is a method that was introduced in 2023 in a paper titled \"Active Retrieval Augmented Generation\" by Zhengbao Jiang, et al. The original implementation can be found in [the paper's GitHub repo](https://github.com/jzbjyb/FLARE), which the LangChain implementation draws heavy inspiration from.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 **Why FLARE Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enhances large language models by fetching info from external sources while generating content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tackles the issue of models making stuff up or being factually wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Aims for outputs that are more accurate and well-informed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 **FLARE's Approach:**\n",
    "- Starts by answering a question.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Looks up relevant documents when hitting \"uncertain\" tokens (based on log probs).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses these documents to keep generating.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Repeats the process until done.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Highlights uncertain tokens and forms questions for LLM to find answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jzbjyb/FLARE/main/res/flare.gif\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤔 **How FLARE Stands Out from Traditional RAG:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traditional RAG fetches info once based on the input, then generates an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can be restrictive for long texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- FLARE keeps deciding **when and what to fetch** during the generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predicts the upcoming sentence to guide future content queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a sentence has low-confidence tokens, it fetches relevant info and rewrites the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💬 **FLARE Prompt Structure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Guides language models to create search queries during answer generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example: \"The colors on the flag of Ghana mean... Red stands for [Search(Ghana flag red meaning)] the blood of martyrs...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 **Direct FLARE Method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses the next sentence generated by the language model for retrieval decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accepts the sentence if the model is confident.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If unsure, transforms the sentence into search queries to get more info, then revises the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠 **Setting Up the FLARE Chain:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **LLM for Answers**: Needs to return log probabilities to spot uncertain tokens. Recommended: OpenAI wrapper (not ChatOpenAI wrapper, as it doesn't return logprobs).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **LLM for Hypothetical Questions**: Can be any model. In this case, we use ChatOpenAI for its speed and cost-effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Retriever**: Any retriever works. Here, the SERPER search engine is used for cost efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔑 **Key Parameters in FLARE:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`max_generation_len`**: Caps the number of tokens generated before checking for uncertainties.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`min_prob`**: Tokens generated with a probability below this threshold are marked as uncertain."
