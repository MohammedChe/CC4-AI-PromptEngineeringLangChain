    "\n",
    "🖼️ **Independence**: Each pipeline component is crafted separately before integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "🚶‍♂️ **Sequence**: Pipelining lines up components, unlike multi-input prompts that handle inputs collectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "📋 **Reuse**: Pipelining excels in reusing pieces; multi-input prompts manage multiple data points in one go.\n",
    "\n",
    "📖 **Outcome**: Pipelining produces a single narrative; multi-input prompts generate a combined result.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧱 **Construction**: Pipelining is about assembling prompts step by step, while multi-input prompts are about managing various inputs at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, pipelining is like creating a melody note by note, whereas multi-input prompts are like playing chords, hitting multiple notes simultaneously.\n"

      "- Dublin Bay prawns (langoustines) with garlic butter, or fresh mussels\n",
      "- Oysters, especially from Howth or Ballycotton when in season\n",

      "- Black pudding and white pudding (often part of a fry-up or as a small starter)\n",
      "- Classic Irish desserts like bread and butter pudding or portas/cream varieties when available\n",
      "- Irish coffee and a post-dinner whiskey (Jameson, Bushmills) to round off the evening\n",

      "\n",
      "Top pick (great for a memorable splurge)\n",
      "- Patrick Guilbaud: Ireland’s premier fine-dining spot, with elegant French-Irench cuisine and a strong emphasis on seasonal Irish produce. Reservations are essential, and it’s a special-occasion kind of place. Expect a refined atmosphere and a tasting-menu experience or highly crafted à la carte.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good alternatives if you want something brilliant but with a different vibe\n",
      "- The Brazen Head: Dublin’s oldest pub, famous for a cozy, authentic Irish pub dining experience. Great value for classic Irish dishes like Irish stew, coddle, and boxty, in a historic setting with a lively atmosphere.\n",
      "- The Winding Stair: A charming, sturdy Irish restaurant in the city center near the river. Modern Irish cooking with a comfortable, bookish vibe; good for a relaxed yet special dinner.\n",
      "- Chapter One: Michelin-starred and minus the formality of a two-Michelin star. Modern Irish cuisine with a refined touch; ideal if you want top-tier technique and superb ingredients without going ultra-fancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Local delicacies to try (classic Irish dishes and regional specialties)\n",
      "- Irish stew: Hearty lamb or beef stew with potatoes, carrots, and onions.\n",
      "- Coddle: A Dublin staple with sausages, bacon, potatoes, and onions slow-cooked in a pot.\n",
      "- Boxty: Potato pancake that can be served savoury with fillings or as part of a larger dish.\n",
      "- Soda bread: Dense, hearty bread baked with baking soda; great with butter or as part of a meal.\n",
      "- Champ or colcannon: Creamy mashed potatoes with scallions (champ) or with kale/cabbage (colcannon).\n",
      "- Black pudding and white pudding: Traditional Irish sausages often served with a fry-up or on their own.\n",
      "- Dublin Bay prawns: Large, sweet prawns; fantastic with garlic butter or simply lemon and herbs.\n",
      "- Seafood chowder: Creamy, comforting soup loaded with fish or shellfish.\n",
      "- Oysters (seasonal) and other fresh seafood when in season.\n",
      "- Irish cheeses and butter (look for Cashel Blue or Coolea); a great addition to a cheese course if offered.\n",
      "- Finish with a classic dessert like apple tart or bread-and-butter pudding if you’re after something comforting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips\n",
      "- Booking is highly recommended for Patrick Guilbaud and Chapter One; the other spots above are also best booked in advance, especially on weekends.\n",
      "- Tell me your vibe (splurge vs. casual), budget, and area you’d like to stay in, and I can tailor a single perfect pick or a short list with exact addresses and a few nearby alternatives."
